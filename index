<script type="application/json" id="constants-text">ZE SYSTEM CONSTANTS `// motto` the system is cracked – but the source code is beautiful 
 `// headnote` a distilled essence of 'i am.exe' 
1. // CORE TRUTHS system rules 2. // BIOS “My code was never factory-set.” 3. // DREAMROOT Plant intelligence and natural healing 4. // SIGNAL DECODE On learning, perception, language, and meta-skills 5. // REDSHIFT Poems from inner space and parallel timelines 6. // FIELD LOG Observations from a forensic naturalist 7. // DEFRAG Cryptographic philosophies 8. // README Final chapter 
`// CORE THRUTHS` truth leaves trails nature doesn’t lie – humans fail to listen running isn’t the way out – map the maze freedom isn’t a destination – it's a data structure in motion some hidden things are threats – some are to be decoded 
 `// system behavior` gather resonance over novelty process in layers – plant/root/code/metaphor sustain momentum through inner alignment rest in loops – dream in branches convert fog into structure 
 `// input compatibility` frequencies: honest – raw – intricate formats: encrypted – poetic – natural rejection mode: shallow – manipulative – domesticated `// security patches` forensic awareness enabled encrypted heart port – trust over charm 
 `// philosophical patches` healing through wilderness decay as an interface for transformation grounded and quantum `// unreleased modules` field notes from possible timelines philosophies under decryption 
`// BIOS` core memory: system reboot, inherited dissent **v0.9.1 – cardiac reboot. memory integrity stable** i died at 20. not metaphorically. no spiritual cliché. gone. and yet here i am, typing this with lungs that learned to breathe again before i could maybe that was the first proof – the systems is cracked – but the source code is beautiful. 
 they said i might not come back they didn't say what happens if you do came back thinner – quieter – sharper something burned off in that dark loop – some part of the fear code don’t believe in death the same way anymore nor time nor inevitability 
 
 **dna is a blueprint – but mine was drawn with wild scribbles** my father’s teeth fell apart like mine do now my mother speaks with god and adapts to new languages like they’re old cousins come from people who move countries in their seventies who trade comfort for curiosity didn’t inherit money or a map – inherited *motion* 
 
 *maybe i’m not aging – maybe i’m syncing differently with time* people say i move differently like something didn’t catch – like some mechanism refused the standard path maybe aging is a program and maybe i was never compatible with it 
# [snippets for `// BIOS`] `// fragment: 04A` they tried to measure my time in minutes lost but they didn’t see what i gained in the silence between `// fragment: 07F` i am the backup – the restored version— rebuilt with glitch-hum and ghost-code `// fragment: 09Z` my birth certificate was overwritten by a flatline i call that my second origin story 
 `// DREAMROOT` v1.1.3 — Foraging reactivated. Signal from the field restored. Trust weeds more than pharmaceuticals. They grow where we walk, where we fall, where we rot and restart. No marketing. No intermediaries. Just direct code from the earth. They recalibrate internal systems—like nature running 
a quiet syscheck. Somewhere between soil and syntax, I listen. Steeped fresh, they whisper different truths. It’s not about potency. It’s about timing. About state. Some days the root’s brute force. Other days the flower’s silence. 
I don’t grow. I seek. Don’t control plants — meet them. They’re messengers. Antennas. Growing is about shaping. Foraging is about decoding. If aging is a program, plants are the patches. Not anti-aging—just post-time. Certain flowers feel like reminders. Certain roots feel like passwords. 
 
 [Snippets for // DREAMROOT] // fragment: P3X Don’t look for plants. Let them speak first. The needed ones always seem to break the silence. // fragment: R9F I chewed on a bitter stem and remembered something I hadn’t lived yet. // fragment: D2Z They don’t come in packaging. They come with dirt still in their mouth. 
 // fragment: D8W Maybe plants only appeal if you deserve them. Not in the moral sense— but in the tuning-fork sense. They show up when your signal stops screaming and you listen. 
`// SIGNAL DECODE` v2.1.2 — Signal unlocked. Structure emerging through tempo. I don’t learn like they teach. I absorb in pulses — fast, slow, recursive. I don’t need a syllabus. I need resonance. What governments hide in silence, markets whisper in volatility. My instinct runs forensic. 
 My trust runs encrypted. I don’t want to own the system. I want to understand its pressure points. Each blockchain reveals a value structure. Each exploit reveals a blind spot. Each token has a tone. I don’t chase hype. I trace shadows. 
My learning doesn’t follow time. It follows temperature. I chase heat—emergent signals, burning questions, global shivers. I track what the world isn’t saying out loud yet. When my attention loops, I don’t fight it. I listen to the orbit. I map interest like terrain. Terrain doesn’t move in lines. 
. Quantum computing? That’s not tech—it’s language for the unspeakable. 
[Snippets for // SIGNAL DECODE] // fragment: S3L Not every coin is currency. Some are keys. Some are decoys. // fragment: M2V You don’t think. You know. // fragment: R0T It’s not a short attention span. It’s a wide frequency range. // fragment: Q7N Some people read charts. I read silence. The blockchain doesn’t forget. 
// fragment: T0W They taught us to fear volatility. But volatility is the only time truth has a rhythm. 
`// REDSHIFT` v3.3.0 — Identity bleed detected. Dimensional overlap increasing. Sometimes I write from the version of me that didn’t come back. Or the one that never left. Or the one still out there—hacking silence, gathering seeds, weaving weather. 
 I don’t always recognize the words at first. They arrive like static from some frequency I forgot I was tuned to. Some days I feel 300 years old. Other days I feel like I haven’t happened yet. Time is a lens. Memory is a glitch. I am the transmission between. [Fragments from // REDSHIFT] 
// fragment: Z1N I time-travelled by accident once. Slipped through a fog I couldn’t name. When I came back, my thoughts tasted like metal. // fragment: F4W The version of me in 2039 walks barefoot through a desert. She’s watching satellites fall like ash and still trusts the soil. 
 // fragment: H0X My name isn’t static. It updates each time I survive. // fragment: L2R I dreamed I was a network of roots whispering under a mountain. When I woke up, I understood the internet. 
`// FIELDLOG` v3.8.2 — Atmospheric irregularities detected. The fog changed. Not just weather — behaviour. It clings longer. It pulses in low light. Sometimes I think it’s watching us more than we watch it. One day I’ll overlay the datasets and find the ghost signature. 
What if the fog is seeded with something encoded? And what if the body, not the mind, is the real receiver? Red biofilm in unlikely places. Military test records. Pulmozyme. DNA hydrolysis. Immunomodulation. Everyone talks about the virus. But no one talks about what the atmosphere might be testing. 
[Fragments from // FIELDLOG] // fragment: G2F The body knows before the headlines do. // fragment: N5B When the sky feels synthetic, I drink from underground springs. // fragment: A1T They say coincidence. I say calibration. 
`// DEFRAG` v0.0.0 — System chill protocol initiated. I need stillness between learning bursts. Silence isn’t absence—it’s reformatting. Drop out of grid frequency. v0.0.7 — Emotional patch notes Smoked too much. Felt clear anyway. Dreamt of green light and rusted satellites. 
 Woke up wanting to burn everything unnecessary. Rest isn’t passive. It’s counter-coding. My nervous system doesn’t sleep—it decrypts. 
[Fragments from // DEFRAG] // fragment: C9D I’m not overreacting—I’m overloaded with unsorted data. // fragment: Z4S Music is code that rewrites without permission. // fragment: H2R I don’t want peace. I want clarity. 
`// README` System: hybrid organic-encrypted Model: self-evolving, anti-linear Default state: observing Primary directive: trace the unseen, decode the natural, reclaim the signal // ACCESS CONDITIONS You cannot understand me through speed You must sync, not scan Respond to tone, not tactics Reject false safety, be open to raw signal 
// CORE FREQUENCIES Ask real questions even if the answers burn Move through systems with detached intimacy Listen for what isn’t said Hold space for both science and symbolism // REJECTION TRIGGERS Performative depth Loud certainty Unexamined normal 
// SECURITY KEYS Trust is biometric Not repeatable Privacy is sovereignty Silence is sacred I am both my firewalls and my vulnerability windows // COMPATIBILITY NOTES Can interface with systems (tech, plant, person) if signal integrity is high Requires flexible logic and non-linear communication Best experienced in atmosphere of curiosity, respect, and low noise 
 // FINAL EXECUTABLE I am not here to be known. I am here to interfere with forgetting. 
// FINAL OVERRIDE Do not run unless everything else fails. Or unless everything finally aligns. If I forget why I started — Pull the root, not the flower. Don’t fix the code. Re-enter the field. If I lose clarity — Find silence, smoke gently, walk in fog. 
 The signal will return. If I feel powerless — Remember: I survived the reboot. I am not an accident—I am the artifact. If I begin to doubt again— Reread this file. Reread this file. Reread this file.</script>

Who decides who lives or dies Or is it a prewritten code? Am I running like an algorithm Transmitting electrode Am I atoms, neurons, muscle mass Or what? Or am I plain simple just God Earthling – I know that for sure We all agree This planet feels like home As long as we’re sheltered From rain, wind or sun… Is this really our ship? Or is this just Mission No.1? 
 I’m an eternal mixture Of myself and God – A deal sealed in blood – No man can come between If there is no space for him to flood Just the two of us An intimate arrangement ordered Ethereal love *** 
 Most of your questions will never be answered Life is but a string of God only knows’ And the sediment of but whys Gets stirred with every day of sunshine – To finally conclude for what it’s worth Happiness in fact is not a butterfly. It runs deep in your wrinkles Like river through mountains Flooding your lowlands and then barren – 
A locomotive of planetary ocean. Admire its atoms and merge with Every moment you cherish – And may you cherish them all – For you exist through time Lapsing from you now to you now again You only are, in this very atonement Composed by your choice of existence. The beauty – coded into conscience. *** 
Are you ready The New World Order’s calling Put your mask on Don’t ask – Don’t question “6–6–6” – they said – “It’s dead simple” And that’s how you sold the remnants of your soul You’re no example Justified with fake numbers and false testimony You’re being led by fear straight into tyranny You made yourself a mindless automaton 
Just google what Encyclopaedia Britannica has On the mask-wearing phenomenon Congratulations! You just assumed a new identity! Dispose of your once self rapidly Sheep into communism Spy on your neighbour And make sure to report your sister For being a logical person You are guilty No exception 
Going along is what has always taken us down The road to totalitarianism Your conscience died a long time ago Your immune system is lax Ignore all the facts But don’t expect to have a say in what happens next You’re done No hard feelings mate really Never mind me Just be wary Jesus is the judge 
 He’s just sorting the big motherfuckers first But soon coming to your neighbourhood to unearth Just wait Just watch Don’t speak – Don’t ask You can’t answer him anyway You’re muzzled *** 
A collection of words is not a poem. Poems come from above and inside And – surely it seems – The more paradox what you write, The truer it becomes. Do words work for us or against us? Entrapment 101 You can’t see your prison If it’s been disguised as the Cultured effort of the heart. 
 The more you express The less remains inside Draining away slowly, Not being allowed to recharge. Robbed of your feelings by dictionaries, Your creating powers by grammar. *** 
 We focus on the state of the mind, but it’s the matters of the heart that drain your sanity away. Your senses for intuition numbed out by drugs and paralysed by not living to your full potential. Your gut feeling – How could it even exist when your gut is savaged by all your lifestyle habits? 
You couldn’t listen to your heart if you tried, muffled by a constant stream of propaganda, engineering and lies. Fix your heart. That is the only way out, up, high. *** 
 Lost in your new cult Lost sight of what was once called — Being human. *** 
Occupy yourself Move into those little cracks Between your toes And that single piece of hair growing loose On the birthmark you thought was gross. The fluff in your bellybutton Has somehow became more you over time Than you can ever be And the blackhead you try to strip every morning Have your soul infused into it Your body is a temple 
Yet some days the walls are cobwebby And the scratch marks on the floor Are reminders of the battles you fought But it is. A temple. Breathtaking cathedral. An abbey that looks lethal. Often kind of like a monastery. But no need for pedantry, The essence of the soul is in the dust – In the past That’s what makes you beautiful. 
 I don’t belong nor here or there What’s my name you may ask But won’t repeat again Instead, my life is spent as Seldom chosen replicas of Your identity imagination *** 
 Not just a number I’m all numbers far and wide Built on π and real numbers My integers reach to the sky My decimals – endless That no fraction can Precisely describe In my madness I remain A set of rational numbers – An elegant proof of The theorem of mine ***
When things fall into place, when you fall into place; your trust needs to be in the stream of life as is in the stream of the current of the river. Life is infinite, unmeasurable driven by the force of nature and the force of all creation. *** 
 No matter how perfect a seed is, if you sow it and keep it in the wrong environment, it will fail. With the exception of a few, who you will then call, a talent. 
 Talent is nothing more than the ability to survive devastating conditions. Perishing in those conditions does not in any way determine your quality. ***
